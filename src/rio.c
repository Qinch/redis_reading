/* rio.c is a simple stream-oriented I/O abstraction that provides an interface
 * to write code that can consume/produce data using different concrete input
 * and output devices. For instance the same rdb.c code using the rio
 * abstraction can be used to read and write the RDB format using in-memory
 * buffers or files.
 *
 * A rio object provides the following methods:
 *  read: read from stream.
 *  write: write to stream.
 *  tell: get the current offset.
 *
 * It is also possible to set a 'checksum' method that is used by rio.c in order
 * to compute a checksum of the data written or read, or to query the rio object
 * for the current checksum.
